# Overview

The challenge objective is to determine the temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round before opening the shop.

# Result
After analyzing the data for the temperatures for June and December, as seen below in the picture (fig 1), we can say that:

-Minimum temperatures in December are 12.5% lower than those in June (56 vs 64),

-Average temperature is above 70 degrees in both months with less than 4 degrees difference

-Max temperature is about 2 degrees difference between June and December

# Conclusions
-Although the minimum temperatures in December are a good 12.5% lower than those in June (56 vs 64), the average temperature is above 70 degrees in both months with less than 4 degrees difference, and the highs around 2, suggesting being warm enough for the surf and ice cream business.

-More samples for the month of June, suggest more precipitations, â€“ see fig.2 below, for the for difference between the two months. It shows that although there are more occurrences tracked for June, the actual volume of rain is higher in December, suggesting that there are just not being tracked or the intensity is higher.

-Highly recommend reasearch about the weather for additional months to define weather in fact keeping the shop open all year long.

-Looking into wind and/or tides historical records would be very instructive for the surfing side of the business
